# My first Streamlit app
Building and deploying my first Streamlit app based on the Disney Films Kaggle dataset [[1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/disney-movies-19372016-total-gross)].

## View deployed app
Have a look at the deployed app [here]().

## Run locally
I recommend creating a virtual environment with anaconda:

`conda create -n streamlit_app python=3.8.12`

To activate this environment:

`conda activate streamlit_app`

Install the necessary requirements (from the app's root directory):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the app on a localhost in your browser using:

`streamlit run app.py`
